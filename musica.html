        <h2>Letra: Faded - Akan Walker</h2>
        <p>
            You were the shadow to my light<br>
            Did you feel us<br>
            Another start<br>
            You fade away<br>
            Afraid our aim is out of sight<br>
            Wanna see us<br>
            Alive<br>
<br>            
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Was it all in my fantasy<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Were you only imaginary<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Atlantis<br>
<br>
            Under the sea<br>
            Under the sea<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Another dream<br>
            The monsters running wild inside of me<br>
<br>
            I'm faded<br>
            I'm faded<br>
            So lost<br>
            I'm faded<br>
<br>
            These shallow waters, never met<br>
            What I needed<br>
            I'm letting go<br>
            A deeper dive<br>
            Eternal silence of the sea<br>
            I'm breathing<br>
            Alive<br>
<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
<br>
            Under the bright<br>
            But faded lights<br>
            You set my heart on fire<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Atlantis<br>
            Under the sea<br>
            Under the sea<br>
            Where are you now<br>
            Another dream<br>
            The monsters running wild inside of me<br>
            I'm faded<br>
            I'm faded<br>
            So lost<br>
            I'm faded<br>

        <h2>Letra: Stressed Out - Twenty One Pilots</h2>
        <p>
            I wish I found some better sounds<br>
            No one's ever heard<br>
            I wish I had a better voice<br>
            That sang some better words<br>
            <br>
            I wish I found some chords<br>
            In an order that is new<br>
            I wish I didn't have to rhyme<br>
            Every time I sang<br>
            I was told when I get older<br>
            All my fears would shrink<br>
            <br>
            But now I'm insecure<br>
            And I care what people think<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            <br>
            Wish we could turn back time<br>
            To the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
            But now we're stressed out<br>
            Wish we could turn back time<br>
            To the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
            But now we're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            We're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            Sometimes a certain smell will<br>
            Take me back to when I was young<br>
            How come I'm never able to identify<br>
            Where it's coming from?<br>
            I'd make a candle out of it<br>
            <br>
            If I ever found it<br>
            Try to sell it, never sell out of it<br>
            I'd probably only sell one<br>
            It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose<br>
            Same clothes, home grown<br>
            The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam<br>
            <br>
            But it would remind us of when<br>
            Nothing really mattered<br>
            Out of student loans and tree house homes<br>
            We all would take the latter<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
            <br>
            Wish we could turn back time<br>
            To the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
            But now we're stressed out<br>
            Wish we could turn back time<br>
            To the good old days<br>
            When our momma sang us to sleep<br>
            But now we're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            Used to play pretend<br>
            Give each other different names<br>
            We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away<br>
            Used to dream of outer space<br>
            But now they're laughing at our face singing<br>
            "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
            <br>
            Used to play pretend<br>
            Give each other different names<br>

            But now we're stressed out<br>
            <br>
            We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
            We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money<br>
            Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
            We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money<br>
            <br>
            Used to play pretend<br>

        <h2>Letra: Fade to Black - Metallica</h2>
        <p>
            Life, it seems, will fade away<br>
            Drifting further, every day<br>
            Getting lost within myself<br>
            Nothing matters, no one else<br>
            I have lost the will to live<br>
            Simply nothing more to give<br>
            There is nothing more for me<br>
            Need the end to set me free<br>
            <br>
            Things not what they used to be<br>
            Missing one inside of me<br>
            Deathly loss, this can't be real<br>
            I cannot stand this hell I feel<br>
            Emptiness is filling me<br>
            To the point of agony<br>
            Growing darkness, taking dawn<br>
            I was me, but now he's gone<br>
            <br>
            No one but me<br>
            Can save myself<br>
            But it's too late<br>
            Now I can't think<br>
            Think why I should even try<br>
            <br>
            Yesterday seems as though<br>
            It never existed<br>
            Death greets me warm<br>
            Now I will just say goodbye<br>
            Bye...<br>
